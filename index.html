        <h2>The Italian Mafia</h2>
        <article>
          <p>The Italian Mafia, also known as the Cosa Nostra, is a criminal organization that originated in Sicily in the late 19th century. It has since spread to other parts of Italy and beyond, becoming one of the most powerful and notorious criminal organizations in the world.</p>
          <p>The Mafia is known for its strict code of silence, known as "omertà", which requires members to keep silent about the organization's activities. This code has been a significant factor in the Mafia's ability to operate undetected for decades.</p>
          <p>Despite its criminal activities, the Mafia has also been involved in various legitimate businesses, including construction, real estate, and hospitality. This has allowed it to maintain a level of legitimacy and influence in society.</p>
          <p>The Mafia's influence extends beyond Italy, with its tentacles reaching into politics, the economy, and even the entertainment industry. Its power and reach have made it a subject of fascination and fear around the world.</p>
